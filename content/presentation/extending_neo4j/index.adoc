== Who ?

* Stefan Armbruster
* Graph Exorcist at Neo Technology
* contributor to Grails and Neo4j
* volunteer firefighter
* @darthvader42 | stefan.armbruster@neotechnology.com








== a graph database...

* great for *complex* data
** _complexity = f(size, uniformity, connectedness)_
* super fast on following connections
* neat query language: *Cypher*


== property graph model

image::{img}/propertygraph.png[]

== deployment: embedded

image::{img}/embedded.png[]


== deployment: server (plain)

image::{img}/server.png[]

== server with extensions

image::{img}/extension.png[]

////
=== running as server

* + separate process / JVM -> less GC fuckup
* + any client language / platform
* +/- just REST to talk to server

== deployment alternatives

=== running in embedded mode

* + maximum performance
* + direct access to Java API
* - requires JVM as client platform
* - life cycle controlled by app

////

== deployment alternatives

* both *embedded* and *server* can be clustered
* both have the same transactionality
* both feature *Cypher*

== unmanaged extensions

[options="step"]
* JAX-RS annoteded Java classes
* expose new REST endpoints
* big power
* big responsibility
* "speak your domain language"

== unmanaged extensions

[options="step"]
* testing is curcial
* *whitebox* and *blackbox* tests

== ingredients 

[options="step"]
* build system: http://www.gradle.org
* git - obviously!
* unmanaged extensions: java + jax rs
* test: http://www.spockframework.org

== ingredients (2)

[options="step"]
* ide / debugger: IntelliJ
* test infrastructure: neo4j-spock-extensions
** https://github.com/sarmbruster/neo4j-spock-extension
* profiler: yourkit

== CypherExecutor 

[source,java]
----
@Context // <-- gets injecteded for you
CypherExecutor cypherExecutor

public void createUser() {
    cypherExecutor.getExecutionEngine().execute("CREATE (:User {name:'Stefan'})")
}
